<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>How are things? We’ve been meaning to write for a while—since 2008, actually, when you posted an article of ours to your (widely read!) blog. You remember, right? “Star Wars: A New Heap,” by John Powers, that elaborate Smithson-inspired disquisition on the relationship between <em>Star Wars</em> and Minimalist sculpture. Apparently sci-fi is the internet’s main artery, because we’ve never gotten more unique hits for any article. No doubt your endorsement sent some eyeballs our way. “It is one of the densest, highest ideas-per-page reads I’ve had in a long time,” you wrote. We copied that and put it on our press page—out of context, so it seems you’re referring to the magazine as a whole, not just a single article. We hope you don’t mind. Hell, just about any movie poster with critics’ blurbs has done worse, right? Thanks so much!</p>
<p>But anyway, we finally got around to writing because we’ve been reading your new book, <em>What Technology Wants</em>. You are, after all, an eminence grise of this unwieldy networked era in which we find ourselves—an early contributor to the <em>Whole Earth Software Catalog</em> in the 1980s, a founding editor of <em>Wired</em> in the 1990s—so it seems as if we should be paying attention to what you say. Your central argument, as far as we can tell, is that fixating on the development and impact of specific technologies misses the big picture. Instead we should focus on what you call “the technium,” a vital energy vibrating all around us. “The technium is now as great a force in our world as nature, and our response to the technium should be similar to our response to nature.” If we conceive of the technium as a natural system, we’ll be able to discern the patterns of technology’s evolution and discern what it wants: efficiency, opportunity, diversity, sentience, beauty (and on from there; your list is quite long). “By following what technology wants, we can be more ready to capture its full gifts.”<a epub:type="noteref" class="footnote-ref" href="notes.xhtml#fn5" id="fnref5">1</a> That’s all well and good, but the thing is, we couldn’t help thinking we had read about what technology wants and how to service its needs before, in terms that weren’t quite so rosy. We thumbed through our libraries till we found it:</p>
<p>It means this War was never political at all, the politics was all theater, all just to keep the people distracted . . . secretly it was being dictated instead by the needs of technology . . . by a conspiracy between human beings and techniques, by something that needed the energy-burst of war, crying, “Money be damned, the very life of [insert name of Nation] is at stake,” but meaning, most likely, <em>dawn is nearly here, I need my night’s blood, my funding, funding, ahh more, more</em>. . . . The real crises were crises of allocation and priority, not among firms—it was only staged to look that way—but among the different Technologies. Plastics, Electronics, Aircraft, and their needs which are understood only by the ruling elite . . .<a epub:type="noteref" class="footnote-ref" href="notes.xhtml#fn6" id="fnref6">2</a></p>
<p>By the ellipses alone, you probably surmised this came from <em>Gravity’s Rainbow</em>. How did you two arrive at such contrary conceptions of what technology wants? You predict peace and prosperity; Pynchon, perpetual war. Is it just the old saying, one man’s technophilia is another man’s paranoid dread? Or maybe it’s part and parcel of the historical trajectory Fred Turner traces in <em>From Counterculture to Cyberculture</em>, where he follows the career path of Stewart Brand to explain how the cultural connotation for computers changed from dehumanizing machines in the early 1960s to a life-affirming means of self-realization in the 1990s? Either way, the juxtaposition underscores what makes us uneasy about your claims. All your recourse to biological metaphor—technological development as species evolution, the technium as the seventh kingdom of life—is a variation on social Darwinism. That is, you attempt to naturalize technology, as if there were no historical actors, as if things couldn’t have turned out otherwise. You don’t consider how technologies have been mobilized to benefit particular economic or political agendas. The question <em>Cui bono?</em> never occurs to you.</p>
<p>What are we trying to say? Yours is a dream of a world without power. In his book, Turner notes that Brand zealously hid from public scrutiny the degree to which control over the <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em> was consolidated with him. We wonder if this wasn’t an original sin of sorts, considering how influential the <em>Catalog</em> proved to be in shaping the popular reception of networked computing in the 1990s. By obscuring the dynamics within his own organization, Brand took the question of power off the table.<a epub:type="noteref" class="footnote-ref" href="notes.xhtml#fn7" id="fnref7">3</a> Power, power was always the dirty secret, and any analysis that fails to account for it has fallen for its ruse. So if we left the study of the internet to you and your fellow boosters at <em>Wired</em>, the “conspiracy between human beings and techniques” would carry on unabated. <em>My funding, funding, ahh more, more</em>. . . . The majority of <em>Gravity’s Rainbow</em>, you’ll remember, takes place in the Zone, that Europe-wide interregnum in the dwindling days of World War II, when national boundaries have dissolved and the main characters shed their allegiances, altering their trajectories and assuming new personae according to their own desires—or so they think, since always they are subjects to power, obeying forces both pervasive and invisible. Sounds like we’re all in the Zone now.</p>
<p>Thanks again!<br />
Three Cheers,</p>
