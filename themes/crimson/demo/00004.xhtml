<section id="_friends" style="page-break-before:always;" epub:type="bodymatter chapter" class="bodymatter chapter"><h1>Friends</h1>
<p>Was that too harsh? Obviously there are other prominent technology enthusiasts we could have singled out, so we hope Kevin understands we chose him out of affection. There’s an affinity between us, a bond. After all, he blogged about us. These days, that’s a direct connection, potentially a deeply personal one. He’s our <em>friend</em>. But what does that word mean now, given the coincidental rise of Mark Zuckerberg and revival of Carl Schmitt? From our perspective, the internet has turned “friendship” into a term of political economy. Most obviously we could point to the connections maintained across social networking sites: affiliations of varying professional and personal intensity, aided and abetted by communication technology but usually stemming from and sustained by face-to-face encounters. There is, however, a second form of “friendship” operating online, one of greater concern to the present discussion, since it has become endemic to the web. It’s <em>de rigueur</em> for magazines to offer mechanisms for registering semianonymous comments, if not entire user-profile systems. These features harbor the promise of virtual communities brought into formation by a publishing platform: passive readers become active participants; each article prompts a long chain of responses, a frenzy of productive conversation. The logic is appealing, yet we have been adamant in refusing to provide Triple Canopy readers with any such comment function. Even after our redesign, which further facilitated our connectivity to social-networking sites, there is no way to “talk back.” Everything published is carefully edited, often elaborately produced, and properly attributed. As far as the website is concerned, Triple Canopy has only authors, no friends.</p>
<p>Is this where our crypto-reactionary tendencies become evident? Have we forsaken a forum for lively debate in the name of editorial control? Does our insistence on retaining a strong “author function” amount to a bid for authority, when a more progressive position might be to encourage what Foucault called “pervasive anonymity”?<a epub:type="noteref" class="footnote-ref" href="notes.xhtml#fn8" id="fnref8">1</a> All good questions, but, we suspect, flawed ones. They rest on the assumption that the internet has the capacity to facilitate a truly democratic process: the more voices that can contribute, the more that may be heard, the greater our ability to arrive at a reasonable consensus, and so on. To put it bluntly, we’re not sure this is a plausible description of our public sphere.</p>

          </div><p>As the political theorist Jodi Dean argues, the proliferation of communication doesn’t automatically enliven debate, but instead often forecloses it. Multiple voices drown each other out; the dream of digital democracy gives way to pure noise. The resulting confusion favors those already in a position to exploit it. “The circulation of content in the dense, intensive networks of global communications relieves top-level actors (corporate, institutional, and governmental) from the obligation to respond,” Dean writes. Drawing on the work of Chantal Mouffe and Ernesto Laclau, Dean argues that true democracy depends on antagonism, which is precisely what can’t happen when messages zip past each other in frictionless circuits, when speech decomposes in a comments section. “There is no response because there is no arrival. There is just the contribution to circulating content.”<a epub:type="noteref" class="footnote-ref" href="notes.xhtml#fn9" id="fnref9">2</a></p>
<p>Obviously there are other takes on the internet’s communication surfeit. In his influential book <em>The Wealth of Networks</em>, Yochai Benkler writes off thinking like Dean’s as “the Babel objection.”<a epub:type="noteref" class="footnote-ref" href="notes.xhtml#fn10" id="fnref10">3</a> (That said, Benkler’s relentless pro-market optimism that the internet always enhances personal autonomy is hard to bear, let alone believe.) But if you buy Dean’s analysis—and we sure do!—then the right approach to today’s media environment is hardly to foster communication for communication’s sake. If online publishing is to distinguish itself from the rest of the internet’s information stream, it mustn’t settle for the easy terms of online friendship. It needs to maintain a degree of idiosyncrasy and difficulty. As a template for this, we’ve always looked toward the flip-books and fold-outs of <em>Aspen</em>, the magazine-in-a-box that so ingeniously coaxed its contributors into unfamiliar formats. A productive friction came from reducing Tony Smith to paper sculpture, or committing Alain Robbe-Grillet to flexi-disc recording. <em>Aspen</em>’s appeal rested on these odd fusions of form, content, and author. To build a similar store of hybrid objects, we prefer to enlist writers and visual artists with little prior experience publishing online, and to expose them to the discomforts of a new medium. The result is a much more intensely collaborative process than any of us ever experienced in print—since it operates on the level not just of text and image, but also of code. Artists’ proposals continually oblige us to consider what’s possible, or even desirable, within the strictures of our platform. A contributor’s original conception often hinges on a programmer’s imagination. In contrast to the rapid-fire posting of most online content, our publishing process can be slow and protracted, with wrong turns and false starts that sometimes lead to confusion and disagreement. Dare we even say antagonism? We’re afraid several of our past contributors would concur.</p>
<p>Of course, there is another vital distinction between authors and friends: authors are paid. (Inevitably and unfortunately, our honoraria are modest and meager, but still, they’re some measure of regard.) Online friendship taps into a vast reserve of uncompensated labor—“friends” as outside contractors without contracts. For the <em>Whole Earth Catalog,</em> Stewart Brand encouraged readers to mail in product reviews and offered ten dollars for accepted submissions. Today, paying for reader contributions is such a rare practice that it sounds quaint and ludicrous, but it shouldn’t. On this topic, Kevin Kelly is joined by a whole chorus of boosters—Benkler, Clay Shirkey, and Tim O’Reilly, to name just three—exulting in Wikiphilia. Certainly the achievement of Wikipedia warrants enthusiasm, but too often the example of this remarkable nonprofit endeavor shields for-profit ventures from tough questions about their attempts to harness the same collective energies. As for Triple Canopy, we’ve entered into enough potentially exploitive relationships ourselves that we’re loath to further propagate any. We’ll keep our consciences clear and keep signing checks. But doing so assumes a steady source of revenue—which obliges us to determine what sort of service we perform.</p>
