<p>At first a convenience, then quickly a conundrum: <em>Of course</em> we would publish on the internet. We came of age with the medium, it was our generation’s default. Plus, financially speaking, it remained—and remains, for now—a wheat-paste endeavor: nine dollars a month to hold down a domain name. A magazine devoid of commercial ambitions but prone to literary pretensions no longer needed a George Plimpton to cut a check covering each month’s shortfall. No time spent amassing capital, only submissions. No printers, distributors, or post-office officials to wrangle with, only collaborators. <em>Online</em>, of course! It was hardly a discussion. But no sooner had we arrived at consensus than the quandaries presented themselves. For starters: though we all spent hours each day scanning screens for information, what on the internet did we actually <em>read</em>?</p>
<p>Our loyalties, you see, were split. The internet was the air we breathed, but print paid the bills. Many of us were fledgling contributors, fact-checkers, editors for publications ranging from <em>Cabinet</em> to the heavyweights at Condé Nast. In a draft of a letter soliciting contributions, we identified ourselves as print’s lackeys. (One editor’s note in tracked changes registers discomfort with the term: “‘Lackeys’ might not work for everyone, but ‘workers’ has a nice doubleness?” Fair enough, but often it’s the accuracy of a word that engenders uneasiness.) We still subscribed, so to speak, to the notion that a true reading experience depended on the material substrate of a page. Our shift from print to online publishing couldn’t be smooth; we had to anticipate, even instigate, some violence in the transfer. We assumed a contradictory stance: embrace the era’s technology, but hold it at arm’s length. That same solicitation letter contains the first instance of our future mantra: <em>Slow down the internet</em>.</p>
<p>Sorry, we got ahead of ourselves. Proper introductions are still in order. For those of you unfamiliar, we are the editors of Triple Canopy, an online magazine based (where else?) in Brooklyn, with satellites in Los Angeles and Berlin. Since March 2008 we have published fifteen issues and organized public programs from Tucson to Sarajevo. Recently we moved into an office and venue at 155 Freeman Street in Greenpoint, along with the microcinema Light Industry and the open-source classroom The Public School New York. To elaborate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Triple Canopy is an online magazine, workspace, and platform for editorial and curatorial activities. Working collaboratively with writers, artists, and researchers, Triple Canopy facilitates projects that engage the Internet’s specific characteristics as a public forum and as a medium, one with its own evolving practices of reading and viewing, economies of attention, and modes of interaction. In doing so, Triple Canopy is charting an expanded field of publication, drawing on the history of print culture while acting as a hub for the exploration of emerging forms and the public spaces constituted around them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We say as much on our grant applications, though with constant revision; apparently, an organization built around a website poses some conceptual difficulties for the review boards that allot funding. If you’re a magazine tracing rivulets through literature, the visual arts, and long-form journalism, what “common good” are you providing, and what “public” do you serve? There’s no extra credit for delving into questions that thorny when applying to the NEA.</p>

              </a>
            </figure>
          </div><p>Perhaps our name is causing some confusion. You may have gleaned from the column inches of various newspapers that Triple Canopy is involved in activities quite distinct from online publishing. Indeed, we are, officially, Canopy Canopy Canopy, Inc., and our URL is <a href="http://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/"><em>canopycanopycanopy.com</em></a>. The legitimate Triple Canopy is a security contractor working with the federal government in Iraq and Afghanistan, among other places, and with corporations based in what its website calls “austere environments.” It was founded by veterans of the US Army Special Forces in 2003, presumably to profit from the free-market outsourcing bonanza of the Bush-Cheney administration. In 2009, Triple Canopy was assigned the contracts previously awarded to the firm Blackwater, which had come under scrutiny after a notorious shooting incident in Baghdad. Also, Triple Canopy is hiring. We know these things because they show up in our Google Alerts.</p>
<p>So we appropriated the strangely beautiful name of a vaguely sinister enterprise. It felt like the right decision for a nation that was, and still is, at war. Maybe we were thinking of Wyndham Lewis’s caustic proclamation in <em>Blast</em>: “Mercenaries were always the best troops.” <a epub:type="noteref" class="footnote-ref" href="notes.xhtml#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a> Regardless, it turns out that the choice of our name was more accurate, more <em>medium-specific</em>, than we could have anticipated. In part, we founded an online magazine to engineer our release from lackey status into independence; but even if we’re no longer lackeys, we’re not exactly free agents either. That was always an impossibility. The pressing question in this essay is whether the shift from print to online publishing actually signals any major transformation. Well, in short, yes. It’s going to take us the rest of this article to explain in full, but it comes down to this: on the internet, we are all contractors.</p>
