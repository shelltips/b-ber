<p>Who are you a contractor for? It’s not an easy question, though often the answer is obvious to everyone but you. Lackeys clamor for the privilege of working long hours in entry-level positions. Dividuals provide the data flow that Google channels through PageRank to generate enormous wealth for its shareholders. Friends contribute their labor <em>gratis</em> in the spirit of Wikiphilia, unrewarded but compelled by a bond of affection that often only goes one way. And mercenaries . . . well, at least they usually understand the terms of the agreement and insist on payment upfront. It’s a confusing situation: we follow what we think are our own desires, yet it leads to the fulfillment of other entities’ needs. When considering the shift from print to online publishing, of course there are substantial differences in the material supports, but the real issues emerge when you begin asking how information technology affects the exercise of power. In the conspiracy between human beings and techniques, whither digital publishing? Marshall McLuhan was right, the shift from typographic to electronic communication is epochal, but just beyond the Global Village is the Zone.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get sidetracked—what with the analytics, the noise, the chatter from friends, the applications to funders, the freelance inquiries. This essay has made clear that Triple Canopy has definitely changed since we launched in 2008, in ways both subtle and substantial. You could say that’s typical of any start-up, but you could also diagnose it as a peculiar strain of technological determinism: Our organizational structure, you see, matches the internet’s. As Galloway explains, the internet is governed by two contradictory logics, one rigidly vertical (Domain Name System, or DNS), the other radically horizontal (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP). Likewise, Triple Canopy has a standard-looking (i.e., hierarchical) masthead, yet in practice we work in a decentralized, networked fashion, with clusters of editors collaborating on the individual projects (or nodes) that together comprise the magazine; those higher up on the masthead have committed more hours per week to Triple Canopy and as a result tend to be involved in more nodes. We enjoy this manner of working, but certainly an organization with no fixed center is susceptible to drift. Without vigilance, Triple Canopy could fall victim to neoliberalism’s imperative of infinite flexibility. This week a magazine, next week a design firm, or a curatorial initiative, or a murkily defined “consultancy.” Maybe our appropriated name will finally cause sufficient brand confusion, and we’ll find ourselves seriously considering a misdirected request for “logistical support” and a junket flight to Kandahar. The internet is a market for new identities: some you purchase, others are foisted on you.</p>
<p>Or Triple Canopy could simply come to an end, like many little magazines before—though it’s not clear how that plays out, either. As a matter of individual staff members leaving, it’s foreseeable enough: we’ll accept teaching positions or writing gigs that pay better, or we’ll simply grow exhausted of group meetings and the grind. But after the masthead collapses, what happens to Triple Canopy the magazine? When a print magazine folds, it stops publishing, and its back-issues languish on private shelves or lie in trash bins; the lucky ones reside in libraries as complete bound sets. Triple Canopy, on the other hand, will rapidly deteriorate: without preservation efforts, the website’s source code will become buggier with each new upgrade of Firefox or the iPad; without payment of storage fees, individual pages will be wiped from servers, leaving only digital traces, dead links, rumors. Dispersal could be the media magazine’s past and future. Perhaps it’s prophecy that Phyllis Johnson published <em>Aspen</em> and then vanished from history,<a epub:type="noteref" class="footnote-ref" href="notes.xhtml#fn11" id="fnref11">1</a> just as Tyrone Slothrop, the putative hero of <em>Gravity’s Rainbow</em>, gradually drops out of the plot and disintegrates. “He has become one plucked albatross. Plucked, hell—<em>stripped</em>. Scattered all over the Zone.”<a epub:type="noteref" class="footnote-ref" href="notes.xhtml#fn12" id="fnref12">2</a> <em>Online</em>, of course! It was hardly a discussion. Little did we know . . .</p>
