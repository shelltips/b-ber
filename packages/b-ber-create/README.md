# b-ber-create

**b-ber** is an authoring environment application suite that generates an array of formats—ePubs, Mobis, PDFs, websites, and more—from canonical source documents written in markdown and custom syntax developed by Triple Canopy.

The `b-ber-create` package is the application's main entry point. See the READMEs in the `src` sub-directories for information about specific modules.
