# `bber-plugins`

`bber-plugins/` contains both custom and third-party extensions to `b-ber`.

`bber-plugins/md/` exports the `b-ber` Markdown parser, which is an instance of [`markdown-it`](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it). `b-ber` directives add custom syntax to the Markdown parser, which allows expressive output through a minimal interface. Read more about custom directives and the Markdown parser [here](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber-creator/tree/master/src/bber-plugins/md).
