# `bber-shapes`

`bber-shapes/dc/` contains lists of [`Dublin CoreÂ®`](http://dublincore.org/) metadata that is referenced throughout the application lifecyle for sorting, ordering, and filtering content.

`bber-shapes/directives/` exports lists of custom directives<a id="custom-directives-ref" href="#custom-directives-note">*</a> that are referenced during when `b-ber` parses and renders Markdown. It also exports information about directives' attributes, as well as expected output (used for testing).
