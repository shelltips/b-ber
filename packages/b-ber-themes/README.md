# `b-ber-themes`

`b-ber` themes are a collection of SCSS files, with a single JavaScript file which is used by `b-ber` to register the theme. They can be made available as packages on `npm`. The main `b-ber` package includes the theme `b-ber-theme-serif`.

The default `b-ber` themes (`b-ber-theme-serif` and `b-ber-theme-sans`) both include a number of mixins and settings which can be used and overriden at the project level. Multiple themes can be used by a single project, and users can also create and integrate their own themes without altering the application's core.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber/wiki/Themes) for more information about using and creating themes.
