# `b-ber-connect`

This directory is a proof of concept for connecting `b-ber` to third party services (Google Drive or Dropbox).

## Premise

A `b-ber` project contains a single `_project` directory and some settings files, which it uses to generate a number of different output formats. The idea here is to host that `_project` directory remotely to simplify collaborative projects.

## Use

You'll need to set up an application on Google Drive/Dropbox and generate API keys.
