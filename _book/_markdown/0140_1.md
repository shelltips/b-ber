# Real Eagles by David Velasco


A black tarp—that’s what it looked like, the sky. There’d been a lot of nights like this lately, as if the world had never cracked.

We’d been casing the place for months, tracking the comings and goings of the staff. People didn’t stay late. Maybe they had years ago, during the great commotion of the Industrious Period, but not these days. A member of our cell had taken a job there, leading around tourists still interested in this kind of stuff, this old art stuff, and she quickly learned how the place operated. Not that this was hard—the building was mostly inert rooms built to evince authority, not hold secrets. Even if the doors had been locked it would’ve been easy enough to get in.

We’d parked the hydrofoil a few blocks away, at Eighth Avenue, not that anyone was out at this time of night. People had problems of their own. The grid was fickle as the weather; they wanted to get home to cook dinner while it was still working. Our plan was simple: Get in, get out, get on the boat, get to the Heights. Barring a flash storm, which, mercy spare us, hadn’t happened in days, there wasn’t much to worry about.

Outside there was no humidity, but the door’s metal handles felt clammy. Past the glass we could just make out the travertine expanse of the lobby. All that emptiness brought on ancient feelings—pride, prestige, vanity. It was so unlike the busy, cluttered spaces of other official buildings. We opened the doors and walked in.

Decades ago, in those early days of the Catastrophe, only people who could make it here and northward survived. After the first floods, hundreds of people squatted in the lobby, which was still dedicated to the Cultivates, those pioneers who took charge of protecting our legacy—and themselves. I was born just as the island began to stabilize, and my first memory of this place was of my mother nudging me around.
“This is where we started our world again,” she said. She was a survivor, one of the early Participants who decided the direction of history. Now people didn’t like to look back so much.

Claire and I took the stairs up to the vaulted central chamber. Tatlin’s Tower stood still in the dark. It looked like an abandoned roller coaster.

“You wanna go for a spin?”

She rolled her eyes.

We encountered our first lock. Claire pulled out her army clip—an artifact, I guess, from her days doing civilian outreach in the Latinates—and fluttered through a few cartridges. She pressed the clip into an indent in the door, we heard a whir, and the glass slid aside.

Our LEDs glanced off the Nevada petroglyphs and Jimmie Durham’s sprawling plywood shrine festooned with notes—one sign read: THE ONLY GOOD INDIANS I EVER SAW WERE DEAD. We moved on, hugging the walls so as not to trip in the nasty fissure in the floor.

“I hope you know where you’re going.”

“I hope you know how to stay quiet.”

“I’m just saying. I’m the witness. I’ve got duties. Watch out for yourself. Anyway, who cares if we’re quiet? This place is dead.”

She frowned. “You think, I’ll act. We can powwow later.”

When I was younger I’d wanted to be a curator. Not today’s archivists and schoolteachers, but one of those antediluvian cowboy heroes working with herds of artists to put together massive exhibitions of new videos, new paintings, new stuff. (Granted, a lot of it recalled old stuff.) I’d marveled at the armies of engineers and producers and dealers enlisted to make and sell it all. Art had power—not just the power to change hearts, but power to mobilize the world. There was even something called
“the art world.” Legions went looking for new art anywhere and everywhere. How many afternoons I’d come to these halls and sit in the Tatlin and make my own shows from what remained of the collection. I liked the wasteful art; the stuff that wore its bad faith proudly, that was excessive or inexplicable or totally interior. Stuff made for no reason, except maybe because it had appeared in someone’s head. I liked how it confused and also justified what was going on in my own head.

We walked through the Kellie Jones Memorial Gallery and the Darby English Memorial Gallery. I paused to admire a small gramophone and some records, a Boogie Woogie. Also, a rare Rauschenberg—a scumbled clutter of photos and envelopes and comics with a torn LP label on top. “So many problems with happiness,” I muttered. His systematic nostalgie de la boue was what brought us here, though this wasn’t the treasure we were after.

Don’t get me wrong. We’d asked for the sculpture several times. I’m not even sure why they hung onto the parts. They’d dismantled it years ago, calling it “unecological.” Funny, since Rauschenberg was known as the ur-recycler, funneling trash into the alembic of art, but people sometimes prefer one message over another—surface message over deep message, as though they don’t prop up each other. Or maybe the museum found its complexity unbearable. Anyway, the Cultivates kept bits of it. Perhaps they secretly hoped to make it again someday, restore that magical combination of materials. But this seemed entirely against the museum’s premise. Originals didn’t matter anymore; reproductions were preferred. There was piety in the ritual of reproduction. Meaning, not matter, mattered, and meaning could be transmitted in all sorts of ways.

Perhaps it’s better off destroyed. The work’s disappearance submerged it in memory’s magical pollution of afterimages. When you’re close to the thing—in the same room, say—its aura disappears. You’re disappointed by its materiality. You’re left with the bleak satisfaction that the thing can share a room with you, a mean pleasure that merely reaffirms yours and the thing’s mutual mortality. Only as you turn to leave the room is the thing’s spiritual dimension reconstituted, as your mind—to honor the loss and preserve the thing for later contemplation—turns again to its nonsensical reflux of associations.

I wondered if the mind’s stupid dream language—or rather, its mysterious techniques of absorption, which contort and so produce our various inner selves—worked better if we never had to confront the thing’s thingness in the first place. Efficiency is meaning’s anemic charm: When you dispense with the hostile object, you can better isolate the thinking behind its making, which in turn frees you to put the thing to uses for which it was, perhaps, never intended.

We continued down the hall. Claire hung a left. I knew better and pushed on, leaving her amid the Latinates and their inspired interventions. She’d want a moment. I went to the blank room. I knew this room best. After dance class with my brothers and sisters we’d come here sometimes. We’d visited for years and years, and the room still made no impression. That was part of its brilliant design.

I donned a pair of spectercles that hung from the wall, turned them on. I traced my finger along my temple, past icons for a woman drawing patterns in the sand and a woman lying beneath Henri Rousseau’s The Sleeping Gypsy, until I found the channel I was looking for. Old video, so it didn’t have that too-vivid, nausea-inducing inflection of RealD. Just flatness. But I loved it anyway. The lenses flickered, and then a blue girl in short shorts and pom-pom hair danced an innocent, geometric lindy hop. I’d never seen anything in the atrium but that hulking Tatlin. But there she was, moving across the atrium floor to old-millennium soul music. No one danced like this anymore, did they?

“Hey,” Claire said, tapping me on the shoulder. I turned. “C’mon. Let’s go. You can look that up later.”

We kept on. Our lights slid through the darkness.

In the next room we had to dim our lights. Everything was reflective, from the cloying puppy in the corner to the silver wallpaper. The reflection lit up Claire’s sepia skin, turning it almost violet.

“It’s in here,” she said, pointing at a door.

The director’s office was just beyond a bank of blackened monitors. At last: a mess. And not just an art mess. We walked into the room, stepping on papers, wigs, a pair of customized football shoulder pads. To the right, in the rear of the office, was a wooden cabinet. In the cabinet was a large box. We lifted the lid.

The stiff, lacquered bird lay on its back. Just some scrappy thing someone had stumbled across in a junk pile a hundred years ago, a few blocks away from where we stood. How it got there was a mystery, but every moment since then had been carefully documented. And now it would really disappear.

“It’s incredible …”

“Do you think it’ll work?”

“Who knows? That’s up to the eco-fems. Me? I don’t see how there’s even any DNA left. But they say if the bones are there, that could be enough for a reconstruction.”

“Could you imagine? Real eagles? It’d be so strange. Next thing you know the clouds will part and the rain will stop and the sky will be full of birds.”
