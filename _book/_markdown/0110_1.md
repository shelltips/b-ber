# One Arrangement of Notes by Adam Pendleton


There are three kinds of exchanges at work in this conversation: borrowing, appropriation, and reworking.

Borrowing involves no change in ownership. A sample is borrowed. When done effectively, sampling creates a dialogue that questions the notion of artistic self-sufficiency. A failed sample is too little, too late, or too much, too soon, and feels either superfluous or exhaustingly overdetermined. Rely too heavily on your source material and the new work becomes mere annotation, a footnote; rely on it too little and the reference becomes ornamental and fails to converse with its source.

Appropriation is a conquest, a flag planted in someone else’s lawn. It is not a sample; it is a claim to the right to a song. The concept of ownership is the condition of possibility for appropriation. Even if the goal of the appropriation is to consider the possibility that nobody actually owns anything, the belief that someone does own that thing is what gives the act its transgressive force. If you and I disagree about who owns a piece of property, we are not disagreeing about it being property, or about the necessity of it having an owner. Appropriation only becomes possible, in other words, when ownership matters.

Reworking—as in a cover—involves a refrain that originated somewhere else or at some other time. Technically speaking, everything is a reworked version of something else. Works from different time periods may resemble each other physically, and vice versa. Yet we agree that one arrangement of notes constitutes something new and original, while another, previously selected group of notes belongs to somebody else. Nobody is expected to invent new notes, yet we can, and some do. 

The question of value lies behind each of these exchange strategies just as the question of weight lies behind the exchange of goods: in the abstract. Value, like weight, emerges from an exchange relationship, precisely as the condition of possibility of that relationship. Without a concept of weight, we cannot explain the obvious motion of the world.

Unlike weight, however, value is not a natural property, but a social one. The Museum of Modern Art, for example, does not collect Richard Serra by the ton. The value of each work—up or down—cannot be determined by weight, but the works can be bought for a price. This is not to say that value is a social construct while weight is not—both concepts are socially constructed—but rather that they are constructed differently.

We are suspicious of those who claim that this or that exchange of violence, exploitation, or domination is not social, but natural—that, in fact, it is perfectly acceptable to shoot an unarmed black teenager six times in broad daylight because, naturally, black life is worth less than white life. There is nothing natural about the casual destruction of black life: It is social all the way; it’s a decision we make together.

The connection between black life, price, and value goes back very far in this part of the world. For four or five centuries, the value of black life was determined by its price. The republic of Haiti, for example, was long considered to be populated by however many masters and several billion francs’ worth of labor that just happened to have come from Africa. When those commodities misbehaved, it was sometimes necessary to kill them.

When those assets rose to assert that their value was more than their assigned price, they were insisting on the recognition of their humanity—insisting, that is, on the difference between price and value, and between the natural and the social. Again and again, what ruling institutions claim were simply assets turn out to have been human all along, a pattern that repeats like the sunrise throughout history.

Kevin Beasley’s sound track is composed of several such moments; it is an appropriation of appropriations, a reworked narrative of a reworked narrative, a set of samples whose identity is borrowed from the identities of its elements.

Humanity is always stolen, always appropriated, borrowed, reworked—these are a few of my favorite things. France admitted as much when it sent its navy to deliver the humans of Haiti a bill for thirty billion dollars, their collective price on the European market. Here is a contradiction! If the ex-slaves actually were subhuman assets, they could not be expected to pay for themselves, but if they could pay for themselves, they never were mere assets. They did, in the end, compensate the people of France for the subsequent two centuries. The road from chattel to citizen is a long one, and we are still traveling it.

The moment we assert our value (I may be poor), we also transcend it.
(But I am somebody.) The moment we demand recognition (I may be uneducated), we become invaluable. (But I am somebody.) When we refuse to be reduced to carrying an assigned value (I must be respected), we become part of the reason value exists in the first place. (I must be protected.) So say it loud.
