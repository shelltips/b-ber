[1](151014_onvalue-text-press-272d.html#footnote-010-backlink). “If we can abstract pathogenicity and hygiene from our notion of dirt, we are left with the old definition of dirt as matter out of place. This is a very suggestive approach. It implies two conditions: a set of ordered relations and a contravention of that order. Dirt, then, is never a unique, isolated event. Where there is dirt there is a system. Dirt is the by-product of a systematic ordering and classification of matter, in so far as ordering involves rejecting inappropriate elements. … Shoes are not dirty in themselves, but it is dirty to place them on the dining table; food is not dirty in itself, but it is dirty to leave cooking utensils in the bedroom, or food bespattered on clothing.” Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo (London: Routledge, 1966), 36–37.

[2](151014_onvalue-text-press-272d.html#footnote-009-backlink). “For the love of money / People will steal from their mother / For the love of money/ People will rob their own brother / For the love of money / People can’t even walk the street / Because they never know / Who in the world they’re gonna beat / For that lean, mean, mean green / Almighty dollar, money.”

[3](151014_onvalue-text-press-272d.html#footnote-008-backlink). “Let Moms tell me what happened to me in the good old days. You couldn’t do nothing you wanted to do. And you better not open your mouth, and if you did they’d knock your brains out. They hit my brother so much … his lips were way down here. Looked like he had on a turtleneck sweater. … Think of somebody picking somebody you got to spend the rest of your days with. Make no difference what kind of condition it was in, if Daddy said so then that was it. I wasn’t nothing but a child. Nothing but a child, fourteen going on fifteen years old, and just as cute as I want to be. Hair hanging down my back—see I’m half Indian, and the other half, the beauty parlor takes care of that!—and this old, dead, puny, moldy man. I mean an old man. Santa Claus looked like his son. He was older than his mother … and his brother was older than him, and he married a girl of thirteen. Didn’t live more than five days. \[Even when he was dead they couldn’t get\] the smile off his face.”

[5](151014_onvalue-text-press-272d.html#footnote-006-backlink). “It is now less convincing than ever to speak of black artists as if they share an enterprise. The work of black artists for whom questions of culture are a subject but visualizing or representing race/identity is not an end obligates us to displace race from its central location in our interpretations of this work. ... It obligates us to expand our view of the many contested fields of possibility out of which ‘black art’ is seen to come, so that we might accommodate in our interpretations all that the work engaged in order to be possible.” Darby English, How to See a Work of Art in Total Darkness (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2007), 11–12.

“Thinking about the technological part of it too is, until we see an individual that’s going to take these technological advances and really do something remarkable, it has no value,” Parrish says. “When you have two people able to do the most basic thing and the most amazing things with those basic materials? You’re good. Everything else just tends to be about what technology can do, or how we can cheapen it and make it easier. I still see that being the attraction \[to DJing\], more so than extreme artistry. Until someone can document certain artists that are doing that, then I’ll be more interested. But until then, I’m not seeing it. I just see convenience.”

[7](151014_onvalue-text-press-272d.html#footnote-004-backlink). “I look in that one kind of dwindled. And in this, / look up, a truncheon in my fist, tin pot / on my head, the war. My father, I’m looking at, is my / age then and thin, his pants streak to the ground, / shadows of rosevines ... His father sits beneath / a cat. Here the shadow has more flavor than my / trains, elbows on livingroom floor, bangs that / curl, opera broadcast, The Surreptitious Adventures of / Nightstick. I lie in the wind of the sun and hear / toots and smell aluminium smoke. The tiny oval / of my mother’s youth in back and the rest is dark.” Clark Coolidge, “Album—A Runthru,” in Own Face (Green Integer, 2000).

3\. “1. To employ her / construction ball / Morning fed on the / light blue wood / of the mouth / cannot understand / (feels deeply).” John Ashbery, “Europe,” in The Tennis Court Oath (Wesleyan, 1962).

[9](151014_onvalue-text-press-272d.html#footnote-002-backlink). “There is no more possibility: a relentless Spinozism. Does he exhaust the possible because he is himself exhausted, or is he exhausted because he has exhausted the possible? He exhausts himself in exhausting the possible, and vice versa. He exhausts that which is not realized through the possible. He has had done with the possible, beyond all tiredness,
‘for to end yet again.’” Gilles Deleuze, “The Exhausted,” SubStance 24, no. 3 (1995).

[10](151014_onvalue-text-press-272d.html#footnote-001-backlink). “The struggle of our new millennium will be one between the ongoing imperative of securing the well-being of our present ethnoclass (i.e., Western bourgeois) conception of the human, Man, which overrepresents itself as if it were the human itself, and that of securing the well-being, and therefore the full cognitive and behavioral autonomy of the human species itself/ourselves.” Sylvia Wynter, “Unsettling the Coloniality of Being/Power/Truth/Freedom: Towards the Human, After Man, Its Overrepresentation—An Argument,” CR: The New Centennial Review 3, no. 3 (Fall 2003).

[11](151014_onvalue-text-press-272d.html#footnote-000-backlink). “I got the idea for the piece in 1972, after I had started to realize that I just couldn’t bring myself to enter into art-world power relationships, with all the compromises, humiliation, and coercion they seemed to demand. A Slave to Art would have required the collaboration of a very powerful and intelligent dealer or collector. … He or she also would have had to be entirely self-aware of the benefits and burdens of his or her position, and recognize the awesome political and social implications that accompany the excesses of this kind of power. … In
\[the piece\], I sell myself as an art object to the dealer in exchange for protection, security, maintenance, and public recognition for at least two and no longer than three weeks. During this period, the person can use my talents and resources in whatever way he or she sees fit.” Adrian Piper, Out of Order, Out of Sight, Volume 1: Selected Writings in Meta-Art, 1968–1992 (MIT Press: 1996).

\* Simpson’s work later drew widespread acclaim: One of his sculptures is on permanent display at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, and his work is part of several permanent collections, including the American Folk Art Museum’s. In 2013, the city of Wilson, North Carolina, established the Vollis Simpson Whirligig Park to permanently display his work.
