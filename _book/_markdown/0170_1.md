# Big Awesome Unexpected Weather by Ana Janevski


1.

I didn’t see the live performance of Untitled (2008). At the time I was living in Warsaw, Poland, working as a curator at the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art. One day, as I did research for a series of dialogues I was planning about the relationship between dance, theater, and visual arts, I encountered a video of Untitled, Ralph Lemon’s performance with Okwui Okpokwasili as part of the 2011 exhibition “On Line: Drawing Through the Twentieth Century” at the Museum of Modern Art.

I wasn’t familiar with Ralph’s work. Watching the video several times on MoMA’s website, I was struck by how Okwui stood in the museum’s cavernous atrium and sobbed; her tears, I later found out, echoed her performance in Ralph’s earlier multimedia theater piece How Can You Stay All Day in House and Not Go Anywhere? (2010), in which Okwui cried for ten minutes on an otherwise empty stage. I wondered how she could possibly achieve such a depth of feeling in the crowded and overwhelmingly public atrium—which, I eventually learned, Ralph referred to as a “diabolic place for dance.” But the diabolical nature of the space seemed to energize him. As he put it in a 2012 interview with the New York Times: “We see ourselves most clearly, often, when we stand in relief against alien environments. These new vantage points contain within them the possibilities for change and growth.”

In the interview that accompanied the performance footage, Ralph and Okwui talked about Andrei Tarkovsky’s film Solaris, about “the exploration of physical and emotional landscapes; about ghostly presence; about collisions and exchanges of energy; about mourning; about relationships; about inhabiting the space.” Even from behind my computer screen, I felt that I could detect these influences in the movement I had just witnessed. Though they began in separate corners, Ralph and Okwui seemed as though they were both sharing in her tears and her pain.

In 2012 I moved to New York and began to work as an associate curator in MoMA’s Department of Media and Performance Art. I was not directly involved in the organization of Some sweet day, a three-week program of dance performances Ralph organized with curator Jenny Schlenzka in fall 2012, but I actively observed its making—from rehearsals to the backstage negotiations between Ralph, the participating artists, and the institution. I became more familiar with Ralph’s practice, which includes drawing, video, photography, and writing. I saw him negotiate with the museum with an unrefined elegance—his interactions with curators at once direct and genial, his tone insistent and kind. I saw how he so fully committed to—and so deeply trusted—the other artists.

Ralph matched six artists to make intergenerational pairs: Steve Paxton and Jérôme Bel, Dean Moss and Faustin Linyekula, Deborah Hay and Sarah Michelson. Each pair took over the atrium during the museum’s daytime hours. Some performed old pieces—Steve Paxton remounted his 1967 work Satisfyin’ Lover—while others, like Deborah Hay, Faustin Linyekula, and Dean Moss, created new work for the occasion. Most pieces made ingenious use of the space, especially, perhaps, Sarah Michelson’s Devotion Study
\#3, which began and ended with security guards escorting a performer up and down the uncovered stairway that connects the atrium to the lobby. Kevin Beasley conducted an intermezzo performance: I Want My Spot Back, a DJ set consisting of a cappella performances by deceased black male rappers from the early to mid-1990s. He transformed sound into a physical sensation, literally shaking the atrium’s walls.

Ralph asked each choreographer to consider three questions as he or she prepared for the series: “How do you inhabit the atrium?” “How do you relate to the choreographer with whom we’ve paired you?” “What is black music?” This last question was absent from public-facing materials. It functioned, Ralph later said, as a “charged internal mark.”

To me, Some sweet day demonstrated that presenting choreographic and dance projects in museums has indeed altered the time-space coordinates of exhibition-making. Some sweet day had an impact on the museum infrastructure, prompting the inclusion of new roles within our curatorial department; a producer had to be hired to provide expertise that no one else in the museum possessed. Presenting dance in the atrium, with its ambiguous social protocols, shifted the relationship between performers and audience—it was both distractingly crowded and, in some ways, more intimate than a theater, since audience members could often wander right up to the performers. Ralph welcomed this friction, enthusiastically identifying three types of audiences and relishing in their collisions: dance audiences, visual art audiences, and people who, as he put it, “were just sort of passing through.”

Hurricane Sandy hit New York during the final preparations for Some sweet day, one week before the performances began, wreaking havoc on every sphere of life. Like those at so many other cultural institutions, we at MoMA scrambled to recover. Somehow, everyone involved in Some sweet day managed to make it to all of the rehearsals and performances. It was an intense and difficult week, but the atmosphere was not somber. The performances provided the sense of relief and joy that comes from being fully in the moment. This might sound simple, but Some sweet day reminded me of people’s strength in the face of life’s unpredictability.

Soon after Some sweet day, Ralph was invited to participate in MoMA’s Artist’s Research Residency program, which gives artists access to the museum’s archives and intellectual resources for one year, during which time they work with museum staff on projects that may or may not involve a finished artwork or public presentation. I was appointed to facilitate Ralph’s residency, along with my colleague Doryun Chong.

The three of us began exchanging emails in May 2013. “I left Some sweet day thinking about value,” Ralph wrote. He wondered about the relationship between monetization and value, or “in the case of performance, the value of a moment.” If “the economy may be our ‘new sacred,’” he asked, “what else is there to worship and/or disrupt?” Ralph expressed interest in researching works in the museum’s collection whose acquisitions had been particularly complex. Following Some sweet day, the possibility was briefly floated that MoMA might somehow formally acquire the series. But what would be acquired? Or as Ralph put it, with amusement, “How does one acquire a memory?” Doryun mentioned Robert Rauschenberg’s notoriously priceless combine Canyon (1959), which features an endangered bald eagle affixed to canvas. (The work was, at that point, on display as part of an exhibition devoted to the collection of Ileana Sonnabend.) I also mentioned the museum’s plan to acquire choreographer Simone Forti’s Dance Constructions (1961), a series of objects and performances based on improvisation and chance, which exists as a result of years of conversations, personal relationships, and the person-to-person transmission of a set of instructions.

Ralph very quickly came to the idea of hosting a series of conversations around acquisitions that posed a challenge to commonplace notions of value. He hoped that these conversations could take the form of
“performance essays.” He encouraged participants to experiment with formats and to craft their talks within hidden or charged spaces in the museum. We agreed that these dialogues, which came to be known as Value Talks, should also address the responsibilities of museums that act as stewards of ephemeral works. How should museums work with artists to manifest ephemeral works that were originally meant to exist outside the museum context? What happens when an artist is intimately connected with the manifestation of the work, when it resides—initially, if only momentarily—within her body? How should a museum treat the work afterward, beyond its usual methods of record-keeping, fixing an object in time, transforming it into stable and accessible knowledge? How might the acquisition of such works challenge the administrative structure of the institution?

We also wanted Value Talks to address questions raised by Some sweet day—about identity, race, place, memory, history, and institutional responsibility—in a manner that was both more overt and more intimate. We struggled to determine whether Value Talks should be public or accessible only to a select audience. We discussed our personal desires to be generous and hospitable, evaluated the accessibility of various museum spaces, and debated the merits and drawbacks of conveying the proceedings using video recordings or courtroom-style sketches. Ultimately, we decided to restrict Value Talks to a core group of invited participants who could attend regularly. The resulting framework hinged on tensions between the desire for inclusivity and the exclusiveness of our small group huddled in various corners of MoMA after hours; between the large scale of such institutions and the close-knit networks of peers; and between the museum’s generosity and the limitations carefully placed on the penetration of its guarded spaces.

Once again, I was fascinated as I watched Ralph interact with the Value Talks participants. His sensitivity and perceptiveness enable him to direct situations and create experiences without people quite realizing that he’s doing so. As the series progressed, I often thought of Ralph’s relationship with Walter Carter, the oldest man in Yazoo City, Mississippi, with whom Ralph enjoyed an eight-year friendship and artistic collaboration. Ralph would regularly share stories with me about Walter and their time together. Often, he’d focus on Walter’s magnanimity and role as teacher and playmate. “My love for Carter was just his generosity and fearlessness,” he said. Their relationship, which is to say their work, of course exceeds Ralph’s photographs, videos, and writings. As I reflected on this relationship, I came to understand that Value Talks was not a deviation from Ralph’s usual method, which involves writing books and orchestrating bodies in space, but was representative of the current that underlies all of his artistic endeavors, in which a set of questions is proposed and then continually brought into motion through new forms, whether discursive, abstract, or corporeal. I also realized that even in the most earnest efforts to acquire, repeat, or represent ephemeral work, there is always something that eludes or exceeds representation, something that resides exclusively in conversations and in relationships, and, for Ralph, in his subtle efforts to animate people. Consequently, Value Talks, however it is represented by this book, was most like “big awesome unexpected weather,” Ralph told me. “Lucky us, the honoring, if we have the proper weather gear.”

My personal relationship to Ralph deepened over this time. He once referred to me as a “sister”; I couldn’t imagine a more flattering comment. I should disclose that I come from an Eastern European, socialist, and post-socialist background. I took the compliment as an acknowledgment that despite our different contexts and experiences, we were both aware of the unresolved, and maybe unresolvable, problems that persist when it comes to retrieving and remembering historical events—past performances; we were both aware of the difficulty of negotiating those events’ assimilation into dominant systems of value.

I couldn’t tell you exactly how Ralph’s “more tangible creative marks”—his performances, books, and visual artworks—factor in to all this, except to say that all his endeavors, whether tangible or not, make me feel as though I am close to an answer, as though I am almost closing the circle. And then, with a smile, he’ll say some little thing that opens the vortex of questions again. This ability of Ralph’s to insinuate himself into your being, to make his experience yours and yours his, is an essential part of his work. It is hardly visible or recordable, but in this book it is more so than ever.
