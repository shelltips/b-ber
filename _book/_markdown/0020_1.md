rl It is apples and oranges we’re talking about.

pb Well, to a certain extent. I think there have been effective presenters who were respected partly because of their ability to serve as an interpretive interface with artists. They didn’t always do it through the use of language, or through the creation of catalogues. Sometimes it was through other kinds of platforms that opened up an artist’s work for a public. But people trained in the written form sometimes look at writing as the exclusive mechanism by which the effectiveness of a curator can be measured.

A presenter might have a full understanding of the evolution of contemporary dance, and might be able to express that history effectively in program notes, or in dialogues in the public, or in conversations with artists. But unless that knowledge also takes the form of an exhibition catalogue, it sometimes doesn’t count in the museum world. We may say it’s a healthy, exciting thing that museums are now historicizing dance, but it’s only through a particular lens. And that lens leaves out a vast part of an approach to documenting dance history and writing about dance and thinking about dance.

sarah michelson This is messy, but I do think it’s fine that the visual art canon—I don’t even know what the visual art canon is, just to be really clear—but if the museum wants to access and include performance in the canon, by whatever means it does so, I think that’s fine. It’s up to them. But that activity represents a separate structure, then—another structure—one that we don’t even have yet, maybe, which is more ephemeral. And maybe we haven’t valued evidence.

You’re talking about the museum, and ownership, and the canon, and art history, and about performance being taken into art history on art history’s terms. At the same time, you’re also referring to a slight misunderstanding or sense of inequality between the ideas of a museum curator and a performance presenter, and what those jobs are. In the art world, the only evidence that works are shown in a particular way and in a particular order is manifest in the curator’s catalogue. The catalogue becomes the evidence. And doing that is a very different job from Philip’s job.

pb Wouldn’t you like to have someone who supports the development of your next dance work also be able to write about it and place it within a historical context?

sm I really, really struggle with it. Sometimes I really feel like I would be relieved, because the smallest part of me would actually like ownership and authorship. But then there’s the prospect of seeing my ideas disappear and then reappear and having no evidence of who did what. So in the smallest part of me, I would like that, but for the larger part of me, the lack of evidence is very healthy for my continued travel.

rl But is that—

sm —Masochistic?

rl No. Do you sincerely feel that?

sm Yes.

rl I think that way sometimes, too. It’s why we are attracted to this ephemeral form, right? But I suspect neither of us, when we began dancing, had that language.

sm No.

rl But this attraction to its basic fleetingness was at its core.

sm That I have to reinvent, that it doesn’t exist when I look back, is very, very painful at times. And I’m hardcore about it. I don’t really have any video. I feel afraid of the distillation of the moment into form. I feel really afraid of it.

rl But someone just came in and gave us some catalogues for a show none of us saw. And since none of us saw the show, the catalogues themselves become the thing—evidence. They can be signed. They can be given away as gifts. I see that as something other than what you’re talking about, Sarah. It’s different from documentation changing your dance. Because documentation can change the nature of your dance, can’t it?

sm I completely agree with that. But there is self-importance to the object.

rl There’s an ego to the object. Sure.

sm And I worry about that.

rl But there’s an ego to your dance.

sm Yeah, but it goes away.

rl Kind of. It flows. You know what I mean? Dance resonates differently than just going away. I think it’s just our own personal psychic hold on how these two worlds are working.
