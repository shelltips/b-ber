# Tour: MoMA 2064 by Claire Bishop


Atrium

Welcome to New York, everyone, and welcome to the Museum of Modern Art. Thank you for joining the evening tour. My name is Claire, and I’m going to be your guide to the contemporary galleries. I’m thrilled to be joining the museum during an anniversary year. When this space, known as the atrium, first opened fifty years ago it was criticized as cavernous, sterile, and corporate. Today, as you can see, it’s a hive of dynamic activity.

The atrium is the core of the museum’s activities. Here you can see a re-creation of Vladimir Tatlin’s Monument to the Third International. Now, most of you will recognize this as a scaled-down version of the big one in Washington, DC. This one is a tenth of the size, but it also has three sections, each rotating at different speeds. The lowest section, which completes a full rotation each year, contains a branch of the New York Public Library, with reading rooms dedicated to visual art and performance. The next floor up rotates once a month and contains spaces for collaborative research; it’s where curators and the public meet to reimagine the museum’s displays in response to current events and priorities. The top floor, which rotates daily and bursts through the roof, is the midtown weather station. From here we continually monitor the climate and issue warnings of hurricanes and floods.

You might not know that Tatlin’s Monumentwas originally designed in 1919 and 1920 to celebrate the second anniversary of the Russian Revolution. At the time, the monument was never built because it was deemed too ambitious from an engineering standpoint. The dynamic, revolving forms were symbolically important for a culture undergoing a wholesale social revolution—which is why the monument seems so relevant for us today. Let’s proceed to the galleries of twentieth- and twenty-first-century contemporary art. People often ask, “How is ‘contemporary art’ defined at MoMA?” Today we understand the contemporary less in terms of periodization and more as a method: This hang is driven by questions that are pressing for our lives today, which require us to look at the past differently—which, in turn, affects how we read the present. Some of the curators refer to this model of history as “anachronic,” because the model of temporality that results isn’t necessarily linear and can involve a “tiger’s leap” backward in time—but I don’t want to get too academic here.

The central concept of the current hang is alternative epistemologies. Western-centric frameworks of knowledge and global capitalism failed us so badly at the beginning of this century, and led to the environmental catastrophe of 2020; now the curators are presenting art through the lenses of epistemologies that were mostly overlooked by the museum in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and which emerged from the various experiences of Native Americans, African Americans, and Latin Americans.

Gallery 1

Since the environmental disaster of 2020, there has been a complete reevaluation of the relationship between people and the land that has for so long characterized Native American communities. The result has been a newfound respect for the environment, for conservation, and for those who have successfully maintained the land for so many centuries—as well as for the kind of communal stewardship they often have practiced. One of the consequences of this resurgent appreciation for Native American culture is a new sense of place. The current display begins with a reminder of where we are: in the Americas. Before us you see a facsimile of the Nevada petroglyphs, which were carved some fifteen thousand years ago. The petroglyph is the oldest form of visual art in the United States, and although there are examples of petroglyphs in New York state, these are the earliest. You can see patterns carved into the rock: trees and diamonds, which may represent the veins of a leaf. It’s important to note that facsimiles are also part of MoMA’s history: Back in 1937, the museum exhibited more than 150 facsimiles of prehistoric rock pictures, which were borrowed from a collection in Frankfurt.

This recent facsimile of the Nevada petroglyphs tells us about today’s philosophy of art, which places less emphasis on the singular original object and more on multiple copies of equal value, shared among museums. Many of the works you’re going to see on this tour are facsimiles. What matters is their meaning, rather than the authenticity of their material support and provenance.

Gallery 2

The first gallery opens with a 2006 work by the North American artist Jimmie Durham, Building a Nation, which is one of his largest installations. As you can see, he used tin barrels, plywood, sticks, old tires, chairs, and Astroturf—the detritus of this country’s industrial landscape. This ramshackle display is accompanied by short texts, in which famous Americans are quoted making derogatory comments about Native Americans. We have Benjamin Franklin, Ronald Reagan, Mark Twain, and Davy Crockett, quotations from hymns, Disney’s Peter Pan, and Irving Berlin’s Annie Get Your Gun. If you look over here there’s a short quote from President Teddy Roosevelt, uttered in 1886: “I don’t go as far as to think that the only good Indians are dead Indians, but I believe nine out of every ten are, and I shouldn’t like to inquire too closely into the case of the tenth.”

Durham’s installation is a powerful reminder of the violent founding of this country, but it also emphasizes the importance of recycling, which today is such an important part of our inheritance from Native American cultures. So you can see that the decision to begin with place is not about celebrating national identity, but about considering our location as the starting point for critical reflection. This marks a huge shift from the beginning of this century—what is often called the era of
“global contemporary” or Art of the Oligarchs—when so many museums ended up looking just like one another, and like international art fairs, with the same kinds of work in each venue no matter where they were in the world.

Gallery 3

We now move into the Kellie Jones Memorial Gallery, which deals with themes of ancestry and legacy, this time in relation to African-American artists. This gallery also allows us to think more precisely about place and location. We’re not just in the Americas but in New York, and specifically on Fifty-Third Street, one block away from Fifty-Second Street, which after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 was the center of jazz for two decades.

In the center of the room is David Hammons’s Chasing the Blue Train
(1989). A toy train painted blue runs along a looped track amid abstract wooden forms. The track is surrounded by paintings that also refer to the legacy of jazz, blues, and bebop. On the right is Romare Bearden’s 1969 collage The Woodshed, which shows a mother and child in a meager home and the father standing outside, playing saxophone, his face a composite of photographs of African sculpture.

We also see Norman Lewis’s 1947 painting Twilight Sounds, an abstract canvas with gestural, looping forms in black, with flashes of white, yellow, and blue, against a blue background. On the back wall are several works by Jean-Michel Basquiat from the 1980s, including Discography and CPRKR. And over here, on the left, is a 1973 work by Hammons called Bird. A rusty shovel is rammed into the top of a saxophone, which hangs on the wall—a reference to the saxophonist Charlie Parker, whose nickname was Bird.

Gallery 4

Improvisation is a key theme of the next gallery, which looks less at the iconography of jazz and blues than at compositional principles of improvisation. This gallery is influenced by the black British cultural theorist Paul Gilroy, who was skeptical about the possibility of race carrying absolute meanings or monopolizing particular aesthetic traditions. The curators show the traffic between black cultural forms and their adoption and reinterpretation by other cultures.

On the far wall of this gallery we have Stuart Davis’s 1938 WPA mural Swing Landscape. As you can see, Davis was a modernist painter with a proto-Pop sensibility. This painting has a neo-Cubist, allover composition in bright, flat colors that are highly rhythmic. Davis was obsessed with jazz and named his son after the pianist Earl Hines. In front of his mural is one of the oldest forms of technology for listening to recorded music, the gramophone. Next to it you can see a selection of jazz records that were in the collections of European modernists like Constantin Brâncuși and Piet Mondrian. Feel free to take off your headphones and put on a record while you look at the rest of the works in the gallery.

I want to point out one particular record, the 1942 compilation Boogie Woogie, owned by Mondrian, whose Broadway Boogie-Woogie, begun the same year, is hung nearby on this wall. The record cover was designed by Alex Steinweiss, who four years earlier pretty much invented the album cover, putting art and music together. The curators feel that this album cover is particularly emblematic of what they are trying to achieve in this display: Two hands are shown playing a piano, one white and one black. The hands are drawn in a loose, biomorphic style evocative of the frond patterns used by Henri Matisse in his 1947 series of cutouts called Jazz, which is on the far wall.

If you come back to this gallery tomorrow, you’ll find the artist Kevin Beasley creating an improvised soundscape with these and other records. Beasley is a bit doddery now and doesn’t often perform in public, so this will be a rare opportunity to see him perform.

Other works in this room include photo documentation of Jean-Jacques Lebel’s happenings from the early 1960s, which, as you can see, incorporated a jazz band and took their improvisational structure from jazz music. Finally, we have Monk, a 1955 painting by Robert Rauschenberg that was named after the pianist Thelonious Monk. This is one of the few Rauschenberg works left after the social and cultural upheavals of 2020. Some of you might remember the uproar in 2022 when Rauschenberg’s Canyon, an assemblage painting from 1959 that featured a stuffed bald eagle, an endangered animal, was destroyed due to its antienvironmental message.

Gallery 5

The next two galleries are conceived as a pendant and deal with the term intervention as a political and aesthetic strategy. They focus on Latin America, where this artistic form was pioneered. The first room shows a large installation by the collective Group Material, which worked in New York beginning in the 1980s. It’s called Timeline: A Chronicle of US Intervention in Central and Latin America, and was first exhibited in 1984. Here the entire gallery is an installation that is also an exhibition, which is typical of Group Material’s curatorial approach to installation art. Running around the room is a timeline of CIA operations in El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and so on, beginning in the 1820s. Hung above and below the timeline are objects, newspaper clippings, and press photographs as well as original artworks made by Group Material’s contemporaries—Leon Golub, Nancy Spero, Haim Steinbach—and historical works, such as this nineteenth-century caricature by Honoré Daumier, a photograph by Tina Modotti, and a work by Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.

Group Material hasn’t arranged the images chronologically but in constellations, encouraging us to see connections across space and time. For example, next to the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, a landmark of United States foreign policy in Latin America, is a Richard Prince picture of a cowboy taken from a Marlboro cigarette advertisement, whose aesthetics allude to the idea of “manifest destiny.” Another important juxtaposition concerns electoral corruption in El Salvador in 1982: At this point in the timeline you see a photomontage from 1933 by John Heartfield, which shows voters intimidated into casting ballots for the Nazi Party.

Be careful where you’re treading on the floor, here … as you can see, it’s strewn with piles of commodities that represent US imports from Central America throughout the twentieth century: coffee beans, copper, tobacco leaves, and bananas.

Gallery 6

While the previous gallery shows United States military interventions into Latin America, this room shows the intervention as an artistic strategy by Latin American artists. An intervention is an uninvited and often illegal action or gesture in public space, and they were deployed to particularly strong effect by artists in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s, when official channels for exhibition were restrictive or oppressive due to military dictatorships installed and supported by the CIA.

We begin in Brazil, with Hélio Oiticica’s Parangolés, from 1964: capes made out of plastic, sackcloth, and netting. They were used for dancing samba, and so for blurring the difference between individual and social. One night in 1966, Oiticica was kicked out of the Museum of Modern Art in Rio for dancing in parangolé capes with black samba dancers from the favelas.

Next to Oiticica’s work are some Coca-Cola bottles by Cildo Meireles, dating from 1970. This work is called Insertions into Ideological Circuits: Coca-Cola Project, because the artist transferred messages onto empty Coca-Cola bottles that only became visible when the bottles were cleaned and refilled. The messages included slogans like “Yankees Go Home” and instructions for making a Molotov cocktail.

And here we have photo documentation of Situacao by Artur Barrio, also from 1970. The artist left five hundred plastic bags containing blood, nails, dung, waste, and other debris in downtown Rio during the peak of the dictatorship.

This display also shows examples of public protest, especially by women, that deploy artistic strategies. Here we have photographs of protests in Argentina in the 1980s. You can see life-size silhouettes painted onto white paper, which represent the hundreds of thousands of people who were disappeared during the Dirty War of the 1970s and 1980s. The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, whose children had been disappeared, marched with these silhouettes through the streets of Buenos Aires.

This wall shows works from Chile by the artist collective CADA, also active in the 1980s. Lotty Rosenfeld, a member of the group, converted white lines on the road into hundreds of white crosses as a memorial to those who had died in the Pinochet dictatorship. These interventions, staged in various locations between 1979 and 1984, were called A Mile of Crosses on the Pavement.

These interventions influenced artist-activist groups in North America, such as ACT UP, which protested government inaction during the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, and more recently Occupy Wall Street in the 2010s, which used a device called the Illuminator to project denunciatory messages on buildings.

All these interventions show the uses of public space for protest and the theatrical nature of street interventions in urban space. They’re not happenings or street performances or open-air exhibitions but guerrilla tactics of disruption and interruption meant to get the public to react, often at great risk to the artists. These works are also important because they remind us of the ways in which artists in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries used art to express their dissatisfaction with society. Today, with all the plutocracies and military dictatorships gone, such interventions are treasured as the most important works of their era because of the role they played in social change.

Gallery 7

The next gallery is dedicated to dance. This reflects the change in values I was just speaking about: Because we have a strong socialist government, and art is no longer tied to the market, we can enjoy all forms of dance without feeling anxious about it being depoliticized.

MoMA has a long history of showing dance. The museum first began to collect ephemera relating to dance in the early 1930s, although the endeavor was short-lived. In the 1970s, MoMA presented live performances in the Sculpture Garden, but it was nothing compared with the 2010s, when there was a craze for inviting dancers into the museum. The dancers hated performing there—but because the museums had a lot of money and prestige they found it hard to say no. Choreographers wanted access to the money that circulated around visual art, even if this meant compromising their works—showing shorter versions, with bad lighting and terrible acoustics. Eventually, museums built dedicated theaters for performance. But this room is devoted to the memory of dance in white-cube gallery spaces.

The room, of course, is completely empty. Please put on a pair of spectercles, digital glasses that let you see the ghosts of past performers and dancers. The spectercles are programmed so that we can all experience the same performance in the space simultaneously—because even when a performance is bad, it’s a collective bonding experience.

Keep the glasses on! You’ll notice the fixed lighting, which is still focused on the walls rather than on the performers. To the left you can see Yvonne Rainer sleeping under Henri Rousseau’s 1897 painting The Sleeping Gypsy. This performance was proposed in 2014 and never realized, but we’ve been able to simulate it here.

To the right, you can see a work from this period by Dame Sarah Michelson. I’m not going to describe it—you can see for yourselves. In the early part of this century, Dame Sarah choreographed a number of works for museums throughout the United States. Soon these museums began to compete to build extensions and new wings to house her works, as MoMA did in 2014 when it began demolishing the folk art museum next door in order to construct a seven-story performance space.

Gallery 8

We’re nearing the end of our tour with this period room called Art of the Oligarchs. It focuses on the status of art at the beginning of this century: a luxury good for the one percent, an asset for speculative investment and profit. During this period, the historical and cultural value of a work of art was entirely subordinated to its financial value. Reputations were made through the market. Each of the works in this room was valued at millions of dollars prior to 2020, and critics of the era participated in this market by defending these works as highly conceptual; they made long arguments about the negation of indexicality, damaged subjectivity, the mixing of abstraction and figuration, digital and analog technologies, and so on.

This gallery shows a selection of artworks as they would have been installed in one of the many homes of an oligarch. The carpet, which covers the floor and two of the walls, is by Rudolf Stingel. It is printed with an enlarged photograph of a Turkish carpet, which as you can see results in a blurry pattern. The large painting hanging on top of the carpet—which looks exactly like silver damask wallpaper—is also by Stingel. Today, art critics tell us that just because an artwork looks like wallpaper, that doesn’t mean it isn’t.

The sculpture in the room is also distinctively of this period: extremely shiny and reflective in the oligarch style; designed to flatter the collectors’ narcissism. There is a Balloon Dog sculpture by Jeff Koons, a curved Anish Kapoor mirror, and—please gather around for the highlight—a reconstruction of Damien Hirst’s diamond-encrusted skull For the Love of God, from 2007, in many ways the ultimate icon of oligarch art.

Let’s look at the paintings on the walls. These are all by artists who competed to evacuate all meaning from their works by creating ever-larger canvases of silver, black, and white that would look good in collectors’ homes. For example, consider this enormous abstraction by Christopher Wool: It’s a blotch of black paint, photographed, digitally altered, and then screen-printed onto a canvas. Next to it is a so-called dust painting by Urs Fischer, who basically photographed some dust in his studio, enlarged the image, and then screen-printed it onto aluminum. The sixteen-foot-long canvas on the back wall is by Wade Guyton. At the beginning of the century, this artist’s works were considered highly collectible, especially the canvases pulled through an ink-jet printer. This particular example has only bit of black ink on the left edge, and the rest is blank.

It’s no coincidence that the paintings in this room are all by men, because they invariably commanded the highest prices at auction.

Over here, on the Bjarne Melgaard coffee table, is a copy of Art Review magazine. This publication was famous not for its coverage of art but for its annual “Power 100” list of wealthy and influential people in the art world. This issue dates from 2012. Let’s see … MoMA director Glenn Lowry dropped from third to ninth place, behind dealers such as Larry Gagosian and David Zwirner and the artist Gerhard Richter. I guess the curators have included this magazine to show us how little there was to differentiate MoMA from commercial galleries during this period.

Many visitors feel queasy when entering this room, as it reminds them of the social inequality that prevailed in the world prior to the unification of interests that became necessary when the globe was threatened with extinction.

Gallery 9

In this final gallery, the curators have decided to show a statistical breakdown of the institution: the annual budget, the sources of income, and how the money is spent. We can also see the number of male and female artists who have shown here, which only became equal in the years after 2020. You can see the number of overblown retrospectives of German painters also really tails off after this date.

Over here we see how much money people used to pay to have galleries named after them, the number of nights per year that were devoted to corporate entertainment and galas, and the pittance received by MoMA for allowing Volkswagen to erect a hideous eyesore of a dome at MoMA PS1.

Particularly interesting is the discrepancy between the director’s wage and that of the rest of the employees. In 2013, MoMA’s director could earn twenty-seven thousand dollars in twenty-seven hours, the same as the annual salary of a unionized worker in the museum. In those days, the museum was beholden to billionaire trustees, who earned that much in mere minutes. Today the situation is much more equal. The institution is now funded by taxpayers, because culture is a resource for all, an archive of the commons—not an object of financial speculation.

We’ve reached the end of the tour! If you’d like to step this way you can return to the atrium, and if this tour has given you ideas for new displays, feel free to use the library and the research labs to help the curators develop the next hang. Thank you for being such a great audience. If you have any questions, I’m happy to take them in person after you’ve removed your headphones.
