# The Gap Between the Two: Glenn Lowry and Will Rawls in Conversation


During Glenn Lowry’s tenure as director at the Museum of Modern Art, which began in 1995, the museum has acquired more than twenty pieces by Robert Rauschenberg. The most momentous acquisition, and also the most vexed, was that of Canyon (1959), one of the artist’s most celebrated Combines, in 2012. After the death of Canyon’s original owner, dealer Ileana Sonnabend, in 2007, the artwork faced years of legal strife due to the stuffed bald eagle affixed to its canvas. Since bald eagles are endangered and therefore illegal to buy or sell, Sonnabend’s heirs found themselves with an artwork of tremendous value—and with a correspondingly high tax burden—that no one could legally purchase. Eventually, the work was gifted to MoMA. Choreographer Will Rawls speaks with Lowry, whose contribution to Value Talks was a lecture on the subject delivered before Canyon, about the museum’s acquisition of this paradoxically priceless artwork, its relationship to the production of institutional narratives, and MoMA’s treatment of other works that resist commonplace notions of value.

will rawls On a personal level—and as an art historian, not just as the director of the museum—what is Canyon’s particular value to you?

glenn lowry Canyon is a remarkable work. First of all, it is a reflection of a friendship that Rauschenberg had with Sari Dienes, another artist who actually found the eagle that became the centerpiece of the work. It’s a haunting meditation on the Greek myth of Ganymede: Zeus assumes the form of an eagle in order to abduct the beautiful mortal Ganymede, because he wants a boy to serve as a cupbearer on Olympus. It’s one of Rauschenberg’s early Combines—objects that are neither painting nor sculpture but that result from bringing objects into contact with two-dimensional surfaces. It’s hauntingly beautiful. And, as one of Rauschenberg’s most important works, Canyon has a story to tell that goes beyond its own iconography. It has this immediate impact as a singular, iconic, definitive object. Canyon is valuable to us at MoMA because it expands the story that the museum can tell about Rauschenberg. And, ironically, it happens to be valueless from a financial point of view.

wr Can you talk about the work’s valuelessness and its relationship to the acquisition?

gl Canyon is legendary because the taxidermied eagle that Dienes found in a pawnshop and gave to Rauschenberg is an endangered species. As the painting’s importance grew, so did its economic value; but because it’s illegal to profit from the sale of an endangered species, and Canyon contains the body of a bald eagle, the work couldn’t be sold. Canyon was owned by the legendary art dealer Ileana Sonnabend, who was a very early supporter of Rauschenberg. She bought the work in 1959 from a show at her former husband Leo Castelli’s gallery. When she died, the painting was part of her estate. The IRS valued it at sixty-five million dollars. But the United States Fish and Wildlife Service said, “If you sell the painting in order to pay your taxes, you will have committed a felony and we’ll prosecute.”

Sonnabend’s heirs were going to have to pay taxes on a sixty-five-million-dollar work of art—but to give away, buy, or sell the work was illegal. The estate executors said, “This just doesn’t make any sense. Either the painting is worth sixty-five million dollars, in which case we will consider selling it or giving it away and taking a tax benefit, or it’s worth zero, because to sell it would be a felony.” The Sonnabend family and its lawyers went to work. They said to the Fish and Wildlife Service, “Will you allow us to give Canyon to a museum—to put it into the public trust—without charging us with a felony?” And Fish and Wildlife said, “Yes, we would be willing to do that.” Then the Sonnabends’ lawyers went to the IRS and said, “If we give the work to a museum, will you zero out its value so that we don’t have to pay taxes on it?” The IRS agreed, and MoMA was the beneficiary. We’ve been so dedicated to Rauschenberg’s work: Canyon joins Rebus, Bed, the Black Mountain paintings, and Overdrive, the great colored silk screen.

wr How do you see Canyon functioning in the museum in the future?

gl The way a museum presents art changes over time because the issues that are important to us change, but you still want to have a series of iconic works around which you can galvanize a conversation. Canyon is one of many such remarkable works at MoMA, and it enables the museum to expand the stories we can tell not just about Rauschenberg but about all that was going on in the late 1950s and 1960s, which enriches the relationship between Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly and Jasper Johns. This work also tells a story about Rauschenberg’s own son, which is complicated, given Rauschenberg’s life.

wr When he made Canyon, he’d just recently had a divorce and taken a lover. His family life is present in Canyon in such a literal way: The photograph of his son affixed to the canvas seems to be such a valuable part of Rauschenberg’s past. It makes me think of the difficulty of preserving one’s past so literally and symbolically in a dance. Of course, all dancing is reliant on the past inasmuch as it requires training, which takes time. But in dance, that past is rendered into the present in a particular, ephemeral way; the present is such a fleeting place to encounter yourself.

gl I think that one of the things museums, especially modern and contemporary ones, do is create a kind of performative space that invites a diverse public to have experiences in common, however differently people may ultimately read those experiences. By dislocating dance from its conventional location—the stage—to an unconventional one—a gallery or an atrium in a museum—you immediately change the relationship between the dancer and his or her audience. There’s no distance anymore. You also change how the audience understands choreography and the performance: It’s no longer dance; it’s art of some sort.

wr However, even in museums viewers sometimes impose a distance between themselves and the performance. When people stand back “to get a better view,” a certain theater-like distance is reintroduced. But it’s also true that these experiences, however mediated, cannot as easily be fixed in narratives as object-based works, which poses a challenge for MoMA inasmuch as it is tasked with crafting narratives about twentieth-century art. And yet you’ve resisted the idea that MoMA is responsible for creating and maintaining these dominant narratives. Why?

gl Our role is to think about the artist and the works of art we find most interesting, not to present them as part of some dominant narrative. A single institution doesn’t establish a canon, unless that institution is the papacy. Canons get established—and broken down—by consensus, by people debating what’s important. I prefer to think of what we do as making propositions. The fact that, in the course of the twentieth century, many of the propositions we made were adopted as dominant narratives speaks to the way in which we argued for those propositions. It does not mean that the narratives are fixed and will last forever.

I hope that we’ve created an institution that’s supple. Yes, we want to make an argument. And we want to make it in the affirmative: “We believe that this is an interesting way to see something.” But we don’t want to make arguments like, “This is the only way to see this,” or, “These are the only objects that are really important,” or, “These are the only histories that matter.” I don’t believe we ever intended to do that, and I certainly don’t believe we intend to now.

What makes art interesting for the public is the existence of competing narratives. Today, MoMA is just one of many major museums of modern art. We can’t do everything. Much of what we don’t do is at least as important as what we do. I’m more comfortable thinking about what we do as making propositions to be criticized, changed, elaborated, refined, abandoned, and revived over time.

wr During your talk, MoMA associate director Kathy Halbreich said something to the effect of “Maybe it’s OK for a museum to lose its narrative.” It sounds like a tension you have to be vigilant about—the tension between advancing and discarding narratives. Given the nature of MoMA as an authoritative platform, how do you say that you believe in something but also invite criticism?

gl There’s always an impression from the outside that MoMA is somehow a monolithic enterprise: Everybody agrees with each other, we’re not self-critical, and we speak from on high like we got ten tablets from the Moses of art history. We didn’t get ten tablets! We got five hundred tablets, and they came in pieces, and we’ve been trying to assemble them, and every time we think we’ve achieved some kind of order they fall apart and we have to reassemble them. We’re actually really interested in what other people think. When I use the word narrative, I mean that we are telling stories—not the story. Each generation adds value to the institution by defining the set of stories it wishes to pursue. Of course, that means excluding certain stories. You make a commitment to doing something at the expense of not doing something else. Another way of creating value is choosing what to do and what not to do.

wr I’m thinking about context and circulation in relation to the museum: The most convincing reason for Canyon’s placement at MoMA is not its pricelessness but the need for it to circulate. How does circulation factor into the question of the value of a work of art?

gl A work like Canyon is always in circulation, even within the museum. Sometimes it’ll be seen in a gallery with other works by Rauschenberg, sometimes it’ll be seen in a gallery with other works owned by Ileana Sonnabend, sometimes it’ll be seen in a gallery with other works from the late 1950s and early 1960s. The moment you start to think of an artwork as being fixed or defined, you diminish its value.

wr An art-conservator friend of mine often talks about the principle of
“inherent vice” in her field, which is when the very nature of an object—the fundamental instability of its components—causes it to deteriorate. One example is a relic made from human remains, like a Tibetan skull bowl. Dance and choreography can be characterized by inherent vice, too, because they are made of human material. Yet the ephemerality of performance is also what can make dance valuable. How do you think the conservation or circulation of dance might contribute to its value?

gl Objects also dance in the museum, although usually at a much slower rate than a dancer. Actually, I think we’re at our best when most of the works we have are moving around, sometimes on and sometimes off view. Absence becomes fascinating in circulation.

wr Having the freedom to move, I think, is one of the most definitive aspects of being a spectator at a museum. What are your own trajectories through MoMA like? What do you experience as a body moving through the space?

gl I enjoy walking through almost any museum, in part because that’s how you experience art—by moving to see something—but also because I like the sense of getting lost. And space changes: The dimensions of a room, the aperture of a doorway, the presence of natural light—all of these things send very subtle physical cues to you; they change how you feel about looking at something. One of the things we try to do in the circuit through the museum is to ensure that it’s very hard not to engage natural light almost all the time: windows, apertures into the atrium, views of the garden, views of Fifty-Third or Fifty-Fourth Street—you haven’t entered a sealed box.

If you work at a museum, your goal is to ensure that the widest possible audience over the longest possible period of time has the opportunity to see, think about, enjoy, and understand artworks. With performances that are by definition ephemeral, the challenge is: How do you ensure that an audience that wasn’t present for the performance gets an opportunity to see and think about it? No two performances can ever be the same, whether by degradation or improvement. What mark is made on an audience member’s inner being by a dance? What are the constitutive elements of that mark? What do you need for that to happen? Is it enough to just talk about it? Do you have to see it? Does it need to be documented? How does it get amplified and known by people who weren’t there? We live in a culture that wants to document everything, so we have this hunger for the visual and the recorded, but sometimes the myth of an event can be as important as the event itself.

wr I love that there is no easy answer. Subsequent generations of choreographers and art historians must take apart and stitch together that myth again and again.

gl What’s important to me is that events become parts of conversations. The ultimate measure of the value of an event is that it resonates to such a degree that it becomes part of an ongoing conversation—it’s debated, critiqued, refined, and elaborated on. The event lives because we talk about it; language becomes crucial to how we know about such things.

wr Absolutely. During Fred Moten and Kevin Beasley’s Value Talks event, Fred identified a paradoxical claim that he explores in relation to black studies: “I had no price but they bought me.” This comment is an indictment of slavery. But it also articulates a broader resistance to the act of putting a price on anything—people especially, but also their work. Do you, or does MoMA, have a stake in this formulation of value?

gl Of course we do, whether we want to or not. We transact all the time. Through acquisitions, through modes of display. You choose a mode of display, and obviously you exclude other opportunities. So of course we are as complicit as any institution in that process. There’s no way out of that box. Every decision comes at the cost of other decisions you don’t make. When you define something, you do it by exclusion as well as by inclusion.

wr By making a choice, you foreclose on another choice, in terms of selecting artists—is that what you mean?

gl I’m speaking about the inclusion of ideas, the inclusion of artists, and the inclusion of publics to the highest degree possible. At the end of the day, that doesn’t mean you are inclusive. Some people may never want to go to a museum. There’s nothing you can do about that, other than hope that you could welcome them if they did. A great deal of art is made, and very little of it will ever be seen in any one museum. The act of deciding is an exclusionary process. I’m highly aware of that. I think Fred’s point is really apt. I agree with him.

wr Fred talks about the act of refusal—about producing dissonance within a value system—and how that dissonance might begin to produce new ways of looking, participating, and, ultimately, being. I assume it’s your hope that MoMA might become as much a home for dissonance as it is a home for sense-making.

gl Of course. If all we do is present what has been culturally accepted, then we are not coming close to fulfilling our mission. Working with Ralph is so interesting because he has a very generous spirit and gentle manner, but he also has a rigorously intellectual way of looking at the world. He was able to include in Value Talks an awful lot of people that needed to be in conversation with the museum, and I hope that will continue.
