# The Blues and the Conceptual State by Adrienne Edwards

At the opening of Kellie Jones’s Value Talks lecture, “On David Hammons, Or the Presence of Art and the Absence of the Artist,” she played a video of activist and poet Amiri Baraka performing his poem “Wailers.” The image of Baraka, accompanied by a drummer and a saxophonist, looped again and again in the square, black auditorium at the Museum of Modern Art. Baraka was in full effect, spitting the lines “Wailing us energy for truth,” “Subterranean night color Magis,” and “Wailers. Eyes seeing the world’s being.” In summoning Baraka’s vitality, Jones marked a personal absence: Baraka was Jones’s father and died in 2014.

As Jones began her lecture on artistic lineage and the work of conceptual artist David Hammons, I was reminded of Baraka’s own complex feelings about the relationship between blackness and conceptual art. For Baraka, conceptualism simply could not approach the matter of blackness. In Jones’s 2011 book, EyeMinded: Living and Writing Contemporary Art, he wrote:

What and Where are you in this hell created by slavery and capital
(which includes colonialism and imperialism)? What has it done to you and how are you reacting or acting toward it?… And what exactly is it signifying? What do these works aspire to do? … It is called conceptual art, therefore we want to know, through the work itself, what is the concept we are being exposed to, but also as my old friend Morris Hines used to say, “And then, so what?”

Baraka questioned the value of conceptual art for people with a particular set of historical, social, economic, and political conditions of existence—that is to say, black people. His understanding of conceptual artworks echoes that of Sol LeWitt, who defined them as being
“generated by a paramount idea.” But if we proceed by way of LeWitt’s definition, such a “paramount idea” might very well be the concept of race and the systems through which it is managed. W.E.B. Du Bois asserts that blackness is a concept in Dusk of Dawn: An Essay Toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept (1940). Most notable in Du Bois’s analysis is the historical and social fashioning of blackness, which results from the organizing systems of modernity; these include the concepts of race and capitalism as well as the institutions and nation-states that sustain them. Consider the historical role of black people as capital, as literal commodities in service of imperialist and colonialist regimes. For artists who want to convey or complicate a particular kind of experiential knowledge of blackness, one that stems from this history of violence being visited on the black body as it was subjected to a vast and abstract network of value that involved capital, commodities, currencies, bonds, and futures, the strategies of conceptual art are highly relevant. It is useful here to evoke what literary theorist Gérard Genette describes as “the conceptual state” in The Work of Art: Immanence and Transcendence (1994). Genette argues that a conceptual artwork does not consist “exclusively and exhaustively in an object.” The conceptual artwork is, rather, a multivalent agent, animated by its own sensual existence and through our sensual encounters with it; the work both informs and is informed by the context of its making and viewing. Genette’s theory necessitates that we think of conceptual art in relation to its inherently performative nature. In order to contemplate how conceptual artworks perform, we must work backward from the work of art to the gesture that realizes it, then to the idea from which it evolves, and ultimately to the sensual events—which is also to say lived experience—that imbue its proposition, whether they’re “critical, paradoxical, provocative, polemical, sarcastic,” or perhaps even traumatic.

Genette’s understanding of conceptualism is, in turn, useful for looking at the ways in which artists such as David Hammons and Ralph Lemon have used the blues as conceptual points of departure in works such as Lemon’s Living Room Dances and in Hammons’s 1997 exhibition “Blues and the Abstract Truth.” Hammons and Lemon deal with conceptualism in precisely the way Genette describes: as an “occasion for aesthetic relation.” Hammons and Lemon displace the cool sterility for which conceptual art is historically known; in its place is the conceptual state, which is to say an acknowledgement of the historical conditions from which conceptual art emerges, accompanied by an acknowledgment of the power of nonliteral interpretations.

Lemon’s private and semiprivate dances in the Delta are collectively referred to as the Living Room Dances, and ultimately informed the evening-length theatrical performances Come home Charley Patton (2004) and How Can You Stay Home All Day and Not Go Anywhere? (2010). Staged in part along the route of the Freedom Bus Rides, which began in 1961, Lemon’s dances took place in diverse locales such as the living rooms of blues musicians’ relatives; the Blue Front juke joint in Bentonia, Mississippi; motel rooms along interstate highways; the graves of blues singers; and the Jackson, Mississippi, driveway of civil rights activist Medgar Evers, which was the site of his assassination in 1963.

Lemon’s 2013 book Come home Charley Patton, which reflects on the origins and life of the eponymous performance, is simultaneously a diaristic account, a collection of drawings, an analytic study, and an ethnographic memoir. In it, Lemon describes himself dancing alone in Yazoo City, Mississippi, on Thanksgiving Day in 2001:

“Minnifield, who was found fishing in the swamp, was accused of attacking a woman with an axe at a point twenty-six miles distant. There was no indication to prove that he was the criminal. When the posse discovered him, he was in the company of another man. Both were seized and charged with the crime. Minnifield’s companion escaped. Angered because he had slipped from their clutches, the mob prepared to burn Minnifield. He was dragged to a cleared space in the swamp, and a stake was driven into the ground until only his head was visible. A match was set to the brush, and as the flames crackled around the man, the woods resounded with the shouts of the mob.”

Empty bleachers and a little stage inside the shell of an old building with no front facade or roof on Main Street. I dance on the stage, occasionally falling through the decaying plywood, to Mississippi John Hurt’s 1928 recording “Louis Collins.” … The song seems appropriate, somebody mourning somebody else, its simple and hypnotic tone a sublime activation. Cars speeding by on Main Street, my audience. A three-minute blues dance, twice, a prayer maybe, to Mr. Minnifield, and to all those who had to run away, in truth or fiction. And then one more dance, but this time a freer movement experiment to the Pretenders’ “Chain Gang,” a hurling body dance just for me, bringing the episode a little more forward in time, while staying backward, I hope. The sky is a radiant blue. And not a single car nor person stops to watch.

Lemon’s mental and somatic processes involve eerie correlations to the crime. Minnifield’s being dragged to an open space is reflected in Lemon’s dancing alone in the remains of a bygone edifice. The hole dug into the ground for Minnifield’s burning is echoed in the fissures dug by Lemon’s feet as he dances. Lemon pays attention to the evolution of musical forms, from the blues to R&B to soul music. The selected songs make up a lyrical counterpoint to the “hurling body dance,” which is shaped by actions such as running, being hosed down with water, and being thrown over a bridge. In all these instances, Lemon uses his body to generate a kind of speculative knowledge, a resonance between past and present. The language and actions are delivered simply; Lemon attends to unspeakably quotidian violence with the most ordinary inflection. In so doing, Lemon does not conjure history merely to allow it to hang in the air as a toxic mood; rather, his simple actions and words seem to be seismically impelled into the very ground, as though historical circumstances are being suspended in the banal character of the landscape. Lemon feels the blues, sussing out blue events to highlight the ways in which the blues is irreducible to a thing or object. The blues in this instance inheres in the narrative and movements through which these events circulate; each recitation, each act, has the power to emanate the blues.

Hammons’s 1997 exhibition “Blues and the Abstract Truth,” at Kunsthalle Bern in Switzerland, marked not only the blues’ sensual conditions and affective force but also the entire constellation of relations through which the blues becomes possible. Hammons deployed the blues affectively, through colors and sounds that converge and disseminate a mood. Hammons washed the seven exhibition spaces in shades of blue by covering all provisions of natural light—windows and skylights—in closely aligned spectral hues of blue foil. The largely empty rooms vibrated with the sounds of blues and jazz music playing from two tape recorders dispersed throughout the upper floor of the exhibition space, one near a large swath of crushed brown paper. Downstairs, a Bang & Olufsen tape deck was installed on the wall. A drum kit with no sticks or drummer sat in another of the downstairs galleries, a brown-hued stuffed cat curled up atop one of the drums, beneath a warm white spotlight.

The blues in this work is not to be found in the music and the objects, but rather in the very sensual encounter between viewers and space—the ways in which the installation materials and the expressions they engender simultaneously are a feeling and structure a feeling, or perhaps even that which precedes a feeling. The objects encased in blue are reminiscent of Baraka’s stance on conceptual art: They are too sparse, too ephemeral, too inadequate to hold the space; they might not move the viewer much on their own. But the blue washes over the viewer, enveloping her before she can name exactly what is felt. The blues registers as a prick of recognition—not a cut. Hammons’s imagining of the blues is an open expanse that imbues the gallery with a plane of connectivity on which sense is distributed. This blue space has the capacity to hold direct signifiers, such as the music and instruments—let’s call those explicit blues—as well as colloquial references to men, the blues-playing “cats.”

Writing about Chris Ofili’s series of dark blue paintings in the catalogue of the artist’s recent exhibition at the New Museum, Glenn Ligon describes “this ‘feeling for a color’ beyond a concern for representation.” He continues, “Blue is the veil through which blackness appears.” In Lemon’s case, this feeling for a color is evident in the emotive register of specific geographic locations in the rural South and the ephemeral recollection of a dance; in Hammons’s case, in the affective resonance of blues and jazz music. This feeling is also an acknowledgment of blackness, which is always already folded into the blues. In approaching the blues as a conceptual state, Lemon and Hammons return us again and again to the conditions under which the blues was formed. These moves are mimetic of the blues itself: Repeat again, yet different every time, as you slide the knife against the strings of the guitar and moan.
