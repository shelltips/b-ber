# `bber-modifiers`

_**TK: mention the markdown-it parser, bber directives, inject tasks, customizing phantomjs PDF output --> actually, better to reference in bber-plugins/readme ...**_

_**TK: reference notes in bber-plugins/readme as well?**_

`bber-modifiers/` contains tasks to maniuplate XTHML once it has been converted from Markdown. The tasks prepare XHTML files for print to PDF, export to InDesign-ready XML, and inject scripts and styles.
